- a_samples.txt: annotation table for the samples. Contains metadata for the samples in the study. First column represents the sample id (cosmic_id) matching colnames in 'm_drug_ic50_gdsc.txt' and 'm_tf_activities_gdsc.txt' files.
- m_drug_ic50_gdsc.txt: numeric matrix. Contains drug response values. Columns represent the samples and rows the drugs. Ids in the columns and raws match the ids in the 1rst columns in the annotation files.
- m_drug_ic50corrected_gdsc.txt: same as m_drug_ic50_gdsc.txt but c50 values have been corrected according the “primary tissue site GDSC2”.
- m_tf_activities_gdsc.txt: numeric matrix. Contains TF activity values. Columns represent the samples and rows the TFs. Ids in the columns and raws match the ids in the 1rst columns in the annotation files.
- r_tf_drug_asso_gdsc.txt: table containing the results from the association tests. First column represents the studied TF. Third column represents the drug id.
